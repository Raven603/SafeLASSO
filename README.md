# LASSO Screening algorithms
Fit l1-regularized linear models on big and wide tabular dataset using state-of-the-art l1 pre-screening rules. The sparse linear models augmented by screenging rules are extended from scikit-learn model class, so common sklearn pipelines can be directly used to fit and validate the model.
